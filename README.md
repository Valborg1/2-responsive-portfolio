# 2-responsive-portfolio

I built a responsive portfolio that consists of an About Me, Portfolio, and Contact page.

Each page is responsive to any changes in screen size to make content consistently accessible and interactive. This is most clearly displayed in the portfolio page which built from sub-rows and columns that change their layout and column width depending on screen size without the use of media queries. Additionally, the portfolio page displays a responsive hover feature through linked CSS.

All pages are connected through the use of a uniform Nav bar and sticky footer, both of which maintain consistent links.
